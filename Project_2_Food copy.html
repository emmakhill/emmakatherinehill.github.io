<p>It is likely you have heard the animal rights argument for switching to a plant-based diet; ask anyone who has tried vegan-ism or vegetarianism why they switched and you are likely to get something along the lines of “I care about animals”. However cliche, it is unlikely you will be able to find a non-vegan or non-vegetarian who claims to hate all animals; instead, to put it bluntly, one can assume that for many people, the pro of eating a hamburger is simply stronger than the con of a cow dying. However, this weighing of cost and benefits may look different and result in a new outcome if more people were also knowledgeable in the environmental implications of what they eat. Thus, through examining the “Food Consumption and CO2 Emissions” data set from <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/2e9bd5a67e09b14d01f616b00f7f7e0931515d24/data/2020/2020-02-18/readme.md">Git Hub’s Tidy Tuesday</a> (contributed by Kasia Kulma, with original data from <a href="https://www.nu3.de/blogs/nutrition/food-carbon-footprint-index-2018">nu3</a> for 2018), we can explore the reality of our foods carbon footprint, as well as explore the varying functions of dplyr within TidyVerse to learn about data wrangling.</p>
<p>Before we start wrangling we need to load our packages and our data set.</p>
<p>First, lets load our necessary R packages, including <em>tidyverse</em> and <em>tidytuesdayR</em>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(tidytuesdayR)</code></pre>
<div id="section-food_consumption-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Food_Consumption Data</h3>
<p>Then lets load our data set from GitHub. This data set, submitted to GitHub by Kasia Kulma, is derived from a study conducted by the website “nu3,” which utilized data provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. It contains information on the annual co2 emissions per person for 130 nations across the world for 11 major food products, including the kilograms of each food product supplied for consumption per person per year (kg food/person/year), as well as the kilograms of co2 produced by the amount of food product consumed per person per year (kg co2/person/year).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>food_consumption &lt;- readr::read_csv(&#39;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-18/food_consumption.csv&#39;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-group_by-and-summarize" class="section level2">
<h2>Group_by() and Summarize():</h2>
<div id="section-summarize" class="section level3">
<h3>Summarize()</h3>
<p>To start, we have the summarize() function, which is great for–you guessed it–reducing/collapsing the rows in our data to calculate very useful <em>summary statistics</em>. Some common summary functions one may use inside of summarize() include mean(), sum(), sd() (aka standard deviation), max(), and more! As an important note, the use of summarize() will produce a <em>new</em> summary data frame, which exists independently of your original data frame and will only contain the columns for each summary statistic you calculated within summarize(). To make this new summary data frame permanent, simply assign a object name to the pipeline using “=” or “&lt;-”. In addition, to be safe, its best to add a “na.rm = TRUE” within your argument, so that any NAs that may exist in your data set are removed from the calculation. Within summarize(), the basic argument looks as follows: summarize([new variable name] = summary_function([columns to summarize], na.rm = TRUE))</p>
</div>
<div id="section-group_by" class="section level3">
<h3>Group_by()</h3>
<p>Next we have the group_by() function, which is almost always used in combination with summarize(), thus making them a common pair! The group_by() function works by aggregating our data into groups based on the levels or categories contained within one or more specific columns, thus allowing us to perform calculations <em>per group</em> instead of across the entire data set. The argument passed within the group_by() function is whichever column(s)/variable(s) you wish to group by according to their levels. You can also group_by multiple columns, however the order matters, as your grouping will occur according to the first column entered, then this grouping will be grouped by the second column entered, and so on. group_by([column1, column2, …])</p>
<p>** Note: without group_by(), summarize() will only return one row for the entire data set, while when used with group_by(), it will return a row for <em>each group</em>. **</p>
<p>Now that we are beginning to understand <em>group_by()</em> and <em>summarize()</em>, lets look at an example of using these two functions within our <em>food_consumption</em> data. These functions can be great for some initial exploration of your data set, especially if your data set is quite large and contains a significant number of observations (rows) or variables (columns). Lets use them to produce a table showing the <em>total_product_emission</em> per each food product category.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>food_consumption %&gt;% 
  group_by(food_category) %&gt;% 
  summarize(total_product_emission = sum(co2_emmission)) </code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 11 × 2
##    food_category            total_product_emission

## 11 Wheat and Wheat Products                 1774.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: Walking through the steps of this pipeline, first in order to create a summary statistic <em>per the various categories within a variable</em>, we must first <em>group_by</em> that <em>variable</em>. So, in order to summarize “per each food product category”, the variable “food_category” was entered as the argument within the group_by() function. Next, to find the “total_product_emission” per food product, we will need to <em>add up</em> the values in <em>“co2_emissions”</em> for each product, which we can accomplish using the <em>sum</em> function. Within our summarize function, we also assigned a name for the new summary variable (column) we are creating, called “total_product_emission”.</p>
<p>Now you try: change the pipeline so that you end up with a table showing the <em>total_food_consumption</em> of all food products <em>for each country</em> (**Although the variable “country” makes it easy to assume we are calculating these values for the entire country, what it really means is on average per person in a specified country).</p>

<p>**We will come back to the code from #2 and #3 later on!</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-mutate" class="section level3">
<h3>Mutate():</h3>
<p>Mutate is a great function if you want to add a new variable to your data set (as a new column) using existing columns! In comparison to summarize(), mutate() <em>leaves all existing rows and columns</em> in your data frame and simply adds on a new column to the end. Within mutate, you can pass a Boolean argument or perform a calculation across variables. Within mutate(), your argument should first include the name of your new variable, then the assignment operator, then your calculation/manipulation. See below: mutate([new_column_name] = …)</p>
<p>Say we want to create a new variable based on whether the “food_product” type is an <em>animal product</em> or <em>non-animal product</em>. This example would require the use Boolean logic–if [this], then “animal_product”, else “non-animal product”–as the argument. We will specifically use an “ifelse()” statement, with the syntax as follows: “ifelse([test], [if true], [if false])”.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: In this mutate function, we first assigned a new variable name as “Type”. Next, we used the “ifelse()” statement as our “calculation” to create a new logical variable with the two levels of “Animal_Product” (True) or “NonAnimal_Product” (False).</p>
<p>As shown in this example, with mutate, we have the ability to create a brand new column with one’s own personally specified levels. This can be particularly helpful when manipulating a data frame containing variables, which as they currently exist, do not quite capture the levels you wish to group by in a summary calculation. Thus, mutate can be useful in conjunction with group_by and summarize. Lets look at how this example extends in this manner.</p>
<p>In the context of analyzing the carbon footprint for different types of diets, I want to now calculate the <em>total consumption</em> and <em>total co2_emission</em> per each <em>country</em> AND for each <em>Type</em> (aka animal products vs non-animal products). This pipeline will combine our immediately prior mutate function, with the group_by/summarize function from exercise #2–except you must make a slight change to one of these two codes. In addition, lets change the name of our new variables (<em>Hint: within the summarize function</em>) from “total_food_consumption” to “type_total_consumption” and “total_food_emission” to “type_total_emission” to differentiate from the variables and table we created in exercise #3.</p>
<p>Your final table should contain 260 rows with 4 columns. Lets see if you can combine these two functions correctly, as well as make the necessary small change:</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: Did you figure out which change needed to be made to the code??? It should have been the addition of <strong>Type</strong> to your group_by() function–specifically in the order “country, Type”– to enable the calculation of <em>total consumption</em> and <em>total co2_emission</em> for both product types for each country.</p>
<p>Finally, lets assign this pipeline to an table named “type_total”:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>type_total = food_consumption %&gt;% 
  mutate(Type = ifelse(food_category %in% c(&quot;Beef&quot;,&quot;Milk - inc. cheese&quot;,&quot;Lamb &amp; Goat&quot;,&quot;Pork&quot;, &quot;Fish&quot;, &quot;Poultry&quot;, &quot;Eggs&quot;), &quot;Animal_Product&quot;, &quot;NonAnimal_Product&quot;)) %&gt;% 
  group_by(country, Type) %&gt;% 
  summarize(type_total_consumption = sum(consumption), type_total_emission = sum(co2_emmission))</code></pre>
<p>Great Work!!</p>

<h3>Left_Join:</h3>
<p>Next we are going to learn about left_join(), which exists in the family of verbs called <em>mutating joins</em> within dplyr. These verbs allow you to add new variables (from one data frame) to another data frame based on matching observations. This idea of <em>matching observations</em> can also be referred to as using a matching <em>“key”</em>. A “key” is a variable/column that exists in both data frames you wish to join and can be used to match the observations from one to the other. Lets look at the syntax for left_join(): TableA %&gt;% left_join(TableB, by = “Key”)</p>
<p>Left_join joins matching rows from TableB to TableA (the left-most table), such that all rows in TableA remain, while only those rows from TableB that match with TableA are joined–more simply, you are just adding on to TableA with that from TableB that matches.</p>
<p>At this current time, we have two independent data frames with useful information. “Type_total” contains the total emission and total consumption per product type for (an average person in) each country, and food_total contains the total emission and total consumption for all foods (consumed by an average person) in each country. My ultimate goal with this data set is that I want to understand how much of a role animal products vs non-animal products play in total food carbon emission rates per individual; in this way, I will be examine the role our food category choices play in the amount of co2 each individual emits into the atmosphere. Thus, I want the data for type_totals and food_totals in the same data frame, which we can accomplish this by using the left_join() function!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>type_food_joined = type_total %&gt;% 
  left_join(food_total, by = &quot;country&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: As I want to keep all the rows in my type_total data frame, while simply adding on the additional variables that exist in my food_total data frame, I used “type_total” as my “TableA” and “food_total” as my “TableB”. Finally, as country is a variable that exists across both data frames, I used it as my key to match the two tables together by shared observations. I then assigned this joining pipeline to the new data table named “type_food_joined”.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-filter" class="section level3">
<h3>Filter():</h3>
<p>Filter() is a great function when you want to return only a <em>select subset of rows</em> from your data set. For this function, you simply identify the criteria–specifically, the types of values within a certain variable–in which you would like your rows to be filtered by. It is common to use comparison/logical operators within Filter(), such as &gt; (greater than), &lt; (less than), &gt;= (greater than or equal to), &lt;= (less than or equal to), == (equal to), != (not equal to). In addition, when using logical operators and Boolean statements, it is important to know that the operator for “and” is “&amp;”, and the operator for “or” is “|”. The basic syntax for filter is as follows: filter([variable name] &gt;/&lt;/=…)</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the next step of graphing, because this data set contains information for a whooping 130 countries total, I want to scale down my data set to a smaller, more meaningful size. Specifically, I would like to visualize the countries with the highest <em>total_food_emission</em> rates per person annually and the countries with the lowest rates. After examining my data, I decide to take the highest 6 and lowest 6 countries for their total_food_emission values. The highest 6 can be filtered by taking the rows with values <em>more than 1700</em>, and the lowest 6 can be filtered by taking the rows with values <em>lower than 225</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: Were you thinking of the right logical operator? This pipeline is tricky because you are trying to return a table with rows <em>greater than 1700</em> and rows <em>less than 225</em>–did the “and” mess you up?–lets think more deeply about the two possible operators. When using “&amp;”, this means that <em>all</em> criteria must true for the argument to be true-thus, in this example, if we were to use <em>and</em>–“total_food_emission &gt; 1700 &amp; total_food_emission &lt; 225”–that would mean that we would only be filtering by rows that meet both of those two criteria, which return <em>zero</em> rows. However, when using <em>|</em>–“total_food_emission &gt; 1700 | total_food_emission &lt; 225”–we are telling R to filter by any rows that meet this <strong>or</strong> that, thus returning all the “this” rows AND all the “that” rows.</p>
<p>To wrap up filter(), lets assign this pipeline to a new table named “type_food_filtered” to use when plotting:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>type_food_filtered = type_food_joined %&gt;% 
  filter(total_food_emission &gt; 1700 | total_food_emission &lt; 225)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-ggplot2" class="section level3">
<h3>ggplot2:</h3>
<p>Now lets plot our final wrangled data frame! We will create a bar graph–a very logical choice given our categorical variable “country”–of the total food emission per country, comparing the amount of total emission from animal products to non-animal products. We will first map “country” onto our x-axis (position) aesthetic and “type_total_emission” onto our y-axis (position) aesthetic within the ggplot() function.</p>
<div id="section-fct_reorder" class="section level4">
<h4>Fct_reorder():</h4>
<p>As you can see in the code below, I also used “fct_reorder” within my aesthetic plotting, specifically in regards to my x-axis aesthetic. <em>Fct_reorder()</em> is a handy function within the <em>forcats</em> package which allows you reorder factor/categorical levels by sorting along the values of another variable. This can be particularly handy as character categorical levels, such as country, are automatically arranged along the x-axis alphabetically. Since I instead want the countries to be arranged in <em>descending order</em> according to <em>type_total_emission</em>, this is what I will include within the fct_reorder() argument. Finally, map “Type” onto the “fill” aesthetic to show the proportion of animal products vs non-animal products within the total emission amount (as a stacked bar graph), adjust the theme and add some labels and Voila!</p>
<p>Plot Code: Total Kg</p>
<pre class="r"><code>type_food_filtered %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(country, type_total_emission, .desc = TRUE), y = type_total_emission)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Type)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .5),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 7)) +
  labs(title = &quot;Food Carbon Footprint per Person Annually&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;6 Highest and 6 Lowest Countries Worldwide&quot;, 
         x = &quot;&quot;,
         y = &quot;Total Emission (Kg co2/person/year)&quot;,
       fill = &quot;Food Category&quot;) +
  scale_fill_manual(labels = c(&quot;Animal Products&quot;, &quot;Non-Animal Products&quot;), 
                      values = c(&quot;brown3&quot;, &quot;olivedrab3&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="Project_2_Food_files/figure-html/total%20emission-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Finally, lets create a second bar graph, looking at the <em>proportion</em> by which animal products vs non-animal products make up the average individual in 12 countries total food <em>consumption</em>. This can be accomplished by simply adding “position =”fill” within the geom_col() argument, and then making some slight adjustments to title names and axes labels:</p>
<p>Plot Code: Proportion</p>
<pre class="r"><code>type_food_filtered %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(country, type_total_consumption, .desc = TRUE), y = type_total_consumption)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Type), position = &quot;fill&quot;) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = .5),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 7)) +
        scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(title = &quot;Food Carbon Footprint per Person Annually&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;6 Highest and 6 Lowest Countries Worldwide for Kg co2/person/year&quot;, 
         x = &quot;&quot;,
         y = &quot;Proportion of Total Food Consumed&quot;,
       fill = &quot;Food Category&quot;) +
  scale_fill_manual(labels = c(&quot;Animal Products&quot;, &quot;Non-Animal Products&quot;), 
                      values = c(&quot;brown3&quot;, &quot;olivedrab3&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="Project_2_Food_files/figure-html/proportion%20emission-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Through examining the two graphs we made, a few major findings become clear. Looking at our first graph, the discrepancy between the highest countries for food co2 emissions per person annually and the bottom counties is shocking, with almost 1500 more kg of co2 being emitted by the top countries. Another interesting finding is the difference between the highest emitting countries and the lowest emitting countries, that being that the highest 6 are composed mainly of highly developed, western nations–including the USA, ranking at the 6th highest–while the lowest 6 are composed mainly of developing or third-world nations. Liberia particularly stands out as the only country by which the average diet is composed more so of <em>non-animal products composing</em> as the majority. Our second graph allows us to look more closely at the proportion of the type of food consumed within each of these 12 nations. As it becomes clear, while the western nations (being the top emitting of co2) have diets composed of only around 25% non-animal products, the third-world developing nations with the lowest food co2 emission rates have diets in which non-animal products make up around 50% or more of their total food consumed.</p>
<p>Thus, a clear picture is painted from the graphs we created through the process of learning to wrangle and manipulate data: the food in which we consume in the western world is contributing significantly to co2 emissions into our atmosphere, with the important factor being our majority animal product derived diets. Compared to nations with vastly less food-related co2 emissions, the western world consumes around 25% or more animal products. Thus, if we hope to move towards fixing climate change and restoring our atmosphere, all of us in the western world should maybe start listening to those crazy, ranting vegetarians and vegans, as they might just have a point.</p>
